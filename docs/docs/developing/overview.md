# Overview

There are a couple ways to getting started on developing first project for Cocos2D-Mono:
- You can use one of the Project Templates for Visual Studio
  - There is also a Visual Studio Extension available to install the Project Templates (which are updated with each release of Cocos2D-Mono)
- You can start from one of the Samples
- There are also NuGet Packages available to make it easy to not have to worry about dependencies

You can check out the options below:

## Templates for Visual Studio

To make things as easy as possible templates for Visual Studio are provided and can be found [here](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono/tree/master/ProjectTemplates).

There are currently templates available as an extension for Visual Studio 2017, 2019 & 2022 [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cocos2D-MonoTeamBrokenWallsStudios.cocos2dmonoprojecttemplates). Additional IDEs will be supported soon!
