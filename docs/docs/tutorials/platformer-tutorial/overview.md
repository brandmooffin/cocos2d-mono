# Building a 2D Platformer - Overview

This tutorial series will guide you through creating a simple 2D platformer game using cocos2d-mono with DesktopGL. We'll break this down into manageable parts, each with clear checkpoints so you can track your progress.

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into several parts, each building upon the previous one:

### [Part 1: Project Setup and Assets](./part-1-setup)
- Setting up a cocos2d-mono DesktopGL project
- Creating and organizing game assets
- Setting up the content pipeline
- **Checkpoint**: A working project that displays a background

### [Part 2: Physics Foundation](./part-2-physics)
- Implementing Box2D physics
- Creating physics helper utilities
- Understanding coordinate systems
- **Checkpoint**: A physics world with gravity

### [Part 3: Player Character](./part-3-player)
- Creating the player character
- Implementing basic movement
- Adding animations and sprites
- **Checkpoint**: A controllable character that moves and animates

### [Part 4: Platforms and Collision](./part-4-platforms)
- Creating platform objects
- Implementing collision detection
- Adding jump mechanics
- **Checkpoint**: A character that can jump on platforms

### [Part 5: Game Mechanics](./part-5-mechanics)
- Adding collectible items
- Implementing scoring system
- Creating UI elements
- **Checkpoint**: A playable game with collectibles and score

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this tutorial series, you'll master:
- Setting up a cocos2d-mono DesktopGL project
- Implementing Box2D physics for realistic movement
- Creating a player character with controls
- Building platforms and obstacles
- Implementing collision detection
- Adding game mechanics like jumping and double-jumping
- Creating a simple level design
- Adding game UI elements
- Polishing the game with effects and sound

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Visual Studio 2019 or newer installed
- .NET Core SDK installed
- Basic C# knowledge
- cocos2d-mono installed (see [Environment Setup](../../getting-started/environment-setup.md))

## Final Result

By the end of this tutorial series, you'll have built a complete 2D platformer featuring:
- Physics-based character movement
- Jump and double-jump mechanics
- Collectible items and scoring
- Sound effects and animations
- A polished user interface
