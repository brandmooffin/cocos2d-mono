# Introduction to Tutorials

Welcome to the cocos2d-mono tutorials section! This area of the documentation is designed to help you learn how to build games with cocos2d-mono through practical, step-by-step guides.

## Available Tutorials

Here you'll find a collection of tutorials that will guide you from the basics to more advanced concepts:

### [2D Platformer Tutorial](./platformer-tutorial/overview.md)
A comprehensive tutorial series that walks you through creating a complete 2D platformer game with physics, animations, and game mechanics. This tutorial is broken down into six parts:

- **Part 1: Project Setup and Assets** - Setting up your development environment and organizing game assets
- **Part 2: Physics Foundation** - Implementing Box2D physics for realistic movement
- **Part 3: Player Character** - Creating a controllable character with animations
- **Part 4: Platforms and Collision** - Building the game world with platforms and collision detection
- **Part 5: Game Mechanics** - Adding collectibles, scoring, and core gameplay elements

Each part builds on the previous one and includes a checkpoint so you can verify your progress.

## Sample Projects

Learning by example is often the best approach. You can find complete sample projects for cocos2d-mono in the following locations:

1. **Tutorial Samples Repository**: The complete code for the tutorials is available in the [cocos2d-mono-samples](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono-samples) repository. These samples include all assets and code needed to run the projects.

2. **Test Projects**: The framework includes a collection of test projects demonstrating specific features. You can find these in the [Tests directory](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono/tree/master/Tests) of the main repository.

3. **Community Projects**: Check the [Discussions](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono/discussions) section of the GitHub repository for community-shared projects and examples.
