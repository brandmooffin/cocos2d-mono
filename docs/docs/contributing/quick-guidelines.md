# Quick Guidelines

Here are a few simple rules and suggestions to remember when contributing to Cocos2D-Mono.

- :bangbang: **NEVER** commit code that you didn't personally write.
- :bangbang: **NEVER** use decompiler tools to steal code and submit it as your own work.
- :bangbang: **NEVER** decompile XNA assemblies and steal Microsoft's copyrighted code.
- **PLEASE** try to keep your PRs focused on a single topic and of a reasonable size or you may be asked to break it up.
- **PLEASE** be sure to write simple and descriptive commit messages.
- **DO NOT** surprise us with new APIs or big new features. Open an issue to discuss your ideas first.
- **DO NOT** reorder type members as it makes it difficult to compare code changes in a PR.
- **DO** try to follow our [coding style](/docs/contributing/code-guidelines.md) for new code.
- **DO** give priority to the existing style of the file you're changing.
- **DO** try to add to the [tests](https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono/tree/master/Tests) when adding new features or fixing bugs.
- **DO NOT** send PRs for code style changes or make code changes just for the sake of style.
- **PLEASE** keep a civil and respectful tone when discussing and reviewing contributions.
- **PLEASE** tell others about Cocos2D-Mono and your contributions via social media.
