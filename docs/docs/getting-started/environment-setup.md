# Environment Setup

## Download and Run

To obtain the code you will need a git client. Either command line or graphical.

Using the git command line you will need to clone the git repository.

> $ git clone https://github.com/brandmooffin/cocos2d-mono.git

Wait until the clone has finished.

You should see something similar to the following:

    Cloning into 'cocos2d-mono'...
    remote: Counting objects: 20553, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7677/7677), done.
    remote: Total 20553 (delta 14127), reused 18870 (delta 12446)
    Receiving objects: 100% (20553/20553), 100.83 MiB | 634 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (14127/14127), done.
    Checking out files: 100% (4130/4130), done.

You now have everything you need to start start developing with Cocos2D-Mono

NOTE: Cocos2D-Mono is currently built with MonoGame Framework 3.8 and included as a nuget package, so no need to pull the MonoGame source code! (Unless you want to anyways, then go for it)
